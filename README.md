# Installing
**Requires LiteLoader**

After installing LiteLoader, copy TabbyChat-2 into your `.minecraft/mods` folder. Don't extract it.

If you wish to use forge on 1.10.x, the minimum version supported is build 2020. A bug was fixed in that version which was causing a crash with mixins (See [#57](../../issues/57)).

# Building
To build, run the following commands. Git is required to be installed.

**Note:** If you are on Linux or Mac, you will need to use `./gradlew` in place of `gradlew`.
```
gradlew setupCIWorkspace
gradlew build
```
TabbyChat will be in the `build/libs` folder
